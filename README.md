# Expense-Tracker

A mobile app developed to track expenses. Includes features such as creating sign up and logging in, creating expense category, creating accounts (bank, cash, revolut, etc.) and adding transaction from account to category (ex: $10 from Revolut to Shopping).

Used Firebase to save user information and their unique category and accounts (has since been deactivated)
